Obviously yes…. Knowing all about it must be your main concern now that you're here.

Well, don’t worry because that’s our work now as we’re here to guide you every step of your way!! 





Where business is involved, busy-ness in its real sense is also involved!!!
And so is the inquisitiveness to dream and turn your business vision into reality.

I’m sure now you can easily guess that the first thing to give a structure to your business outlook starts with the ideation process.

A striking solution you need to come up with to solve the problem you’re targeting. But wait, the ideation process is not over yet. 

Why? The reason founders end up giving it all up is that they fail to pause, take a step back, and review the key indicators that would tell them whether their specific version of the idea is worth doing.
 That’s when the feasibility test of your idea gets a green signal in your to-do-list.`,

Is our market opportunity big enough to build a meaningful business?
Sometimes an opportunity exists, but it's not that important to carve a meaningful business out of. Some businesses are not huge opportunities. But it’s OK!

There are 3 steps involved in the process 
Expert Selection
We'll figure out which areas of your proposal need expert advice and then select the best experts to comment on those specific issues.
 
Key Questions
Asking and seeking opinion on critical questions can allay your doubts regarding the risks you foresee that might hinder your business progress.
 
Results Analysis
Comparing the results can help us recognize any patterns we can infer in order to restructure our business model.
 
Step 1: Expert Selection
The experts we identify are typically:
Subject Matter Experts. Subject matter experts can provide us with a pragmatic view as to how challenging each aspect of our business model can be.
Expert Founders. A smooth conversation with an expert Founder can also aid us in setting the criticality aspect right that can accelerate your plan dramatically.
Investors. Investors can give you useful feedback on how big they envision your market arena. So in that sense, you don’t need to be raising capital to get good feedback from investors.
 
Step 2: Key Questions
The key questions model vary based on your particular concept or precisely on the basis of following questions:
Is this feasible?
Feasibility test sets everything right by telling the likelihood of any major hurdles acting as a threat toward your growing business.
What pitfalls should we avoid?
Experts can tell you what shortcomings to avoid altogether. We must list and address such problems these experts may identify and build a safety plan in order to avoid such barriers.
What are we not asking?
A Questionnaire should be formulated and tailored with the intent of getting actionable feedback from the expert in a detailed and insightful manner.
Step 3: Analysis of Results
Mind you, the experts can guide you in getting your answers, not the final decision as to whether we should give a green signal to this idea or not.
Did we hit a hard stop or reset?
Sometimes the interviews will yield an answer that can plunge you to the state of dropping that idea altogether. In this case we may have to get back to square one- to the research phase.
What was the most consistent opportunity?
After seeking expert opinion, you can explore which aspect of your new product created the most obvious benefit or opportunity? 
Is it time to talk to customers?
If we are of the view that we passed our feasibility test , it’s time to talk to customers directly.

It basically spells out an archetype featuring all the customer profiles representing different use cases of the product like what would attract people to buy your product, what problem is your product  capable of solving, what are the different ways your product can be used by customers. 
Focussing on simple yet obvious customer attributes that clearly represent your audience would add value to your business plan.
STEP 2: CHOOSE YOUR VALIDATION METHOD
Getting validation from the potential customers adds lucidity and perspicacity to your business idea.
LANDING PAGE- Landing page is the star or let’s just say the main highlight of your hours and hours of hard work. Under the landing page, people would have to input their name and email to see if they are interested in what you offer. Pre-selling your solution is evident to know if people are willing to pay for what you have.
Digital Advertising- Advertising via social media can be a real game-changer to explore the interest area of your target customer base. This gives an insight of business metrics like- Cost incurred to acquire a potential user, word of mouth with which you can resonate with your target audience.
Survey- Surveys can be conducted online capturing various channels. Or alternatively, in-person enumeration can be quite effective and you could potentially conduct those one-on-one sessions. 
Step 3: Conduct Customer Validation

ELEVATOR PITCH

Elevator Pitch is something that can give “Do or die!” A real meaning. It can either have a long lasting impression or can go totally ignored. It’s a verbatim, appealing, interactive sales pitch that you can deliver to your end customers to have them grabbing the opportunity to try your products/services!

A well-crafted Elevator Pitch can open all kinds of doors with potential partners, customers, future employees, and investors. 
Do you need one?
If you’re an entrepreneur, business owner, an aspiring one—then “Yes, you are in need of an elevator pitch!” A 30-second elevator pitch helps you to sell yourself, your goals, and your big ideas to the end customers.

Where and when to use your elevator speech?
You can use your elevator pitch to spur interest in your customer’s mind about your business in lot many situations:
When you meet a potential client or business connection.
On your website’s homepage.
At networking events.
At social gatherings.
To help you secure funding or investment.

      title: "How to write an elevator pitch?      ",
      para: `The bigger question is what information you should include? How long should an elevator pitch be? There’s more than one way to develop a persuasive and an interactive pitch. To get started, just answer a few questions about your business:
Who are you?
What do you do?
What problem do your customers face?
How do you help them solve it?
Why is your solution better than those offered by competitors?
Step 1: Nail The Problem
Founders at times miss out on giving due importance to the bottlenecks and the Solution. A finely tailored problem adds the value of your solution and can put your plan running in different directions.
Step 2: Explain The Solution
Once you've articulated the Problem, the next step is to enunciate how this problem can be fixed.
 Founders usually presume that their customer base already has a need for their product. 
Take time to figure out the actual need and potential reach of your product.
Step 3: Identify the TAM
The Market Size spells out how much potential for growth your startup has. Investors want to know how better you're able to target the problem in the given market.
     The Three Pies of Market Size

                Your market size is typically segmented into three pies-
TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET- This encapsulates the market share you feel your product/service has the capacity to reach. 
SERVED ADDRESSABLE MARKET- Customize the entire TAM by how many of those potential customers you can reasonably convert into actual ones. Remember you can only serve as many customers as your sales and marketing channels will require you to.
TARGET MARKET- Time to put your thinking caps on! This is where you need to be clear about your target market to actually put the key to your business vision.

      title: "Tips on how to deliver a confident elevator pitch      ",
      para: `Get them hooked- Once you’ve introduced yourself, you’ve got to keep the audience hooked by stressing on the main highlights/features which would compel them to use your product/service over the others.
Avoid Jargons- Delivering a confident elevator pinch doesn’t mean you should make it too complex so that the end users are not able to get it. Better is to keep it short, precise and engaging but not monotonous.
Using comparison- Comparing it to something that already exists can help you meet your set benchmark.
Add emotional touch- Adding an emotional touch can help you pull your audience towards your business concept. So yes, be a tad dramatic and you’re done!!
End by asking an open question- Making your pitch persuasive is the key. This can be done by employing the use of conversation instead of just saying everything in one go.
 
Close with a call-to-action. A vivid call-to-action (CTA) lets your audience get a sneak-peak of your startup. Think about your end goal. Do answer most sought after questions like- Do you want the chance to pitch for investment, make a new business connection or interview for your dream job?
